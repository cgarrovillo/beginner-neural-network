# Beginner neural network

The purpose of this project was to get myself involved in mathematics, I'm more of a design guy than strictly logical.

This is a super simplified Neural Network that outputs a gender (label) based on `weight` & `height` as the input (features).

Each neuron output is calculated using a **Sigmoid activation Function**, and
the model is trained using a **Stochastic Gradient Descent** algorithm.

**Loss** is minimized by using _backpropagation_ to calculate _partial derivatives_ with respect to neuron weights or biases.
